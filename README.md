# Shopify_Intern_Task

This is the submission for the shopify backend developer intern challenge - 2022.
I have implemented a basic inventory management system with CRUD functionality.
The additional feature which I have implemented is adding warehouses and assigning items to warehouses along with the quantity of items.
I have used python with flask framework, and sqlite in-memory database for completing the task.

The deployed repl.it for this repository is here

Alternatively this can be deployed on repl.it by following these steps:
1. Open repl.it and click on create and then import from github.
2. Give the link for the repository while importing.
3. The libraries will be installed automatically once the above step is done.
4. Click on run. This will run the web app.
