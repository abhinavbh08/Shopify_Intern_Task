# Shopify_Intern_Task

This is the submission for the shopify backend developer intern challenge - 2022.
I have implemented a basic inventory management system with CRUD functionality.
The additional feature which I have implemented is adding warehouses and assigning items to warehouses along with the quantity of items.
I have used python with flask framework, and sqlite in-memory database for completing the task.

The deployed repl.it for this repository is here: [https://replit.com/@AbhinavBhatt/ShopifyInternTaskv=1](https://replit.com/@AbhinavBhatt/ShopifyInternTask?v=1)

3. CLick on run.
4. The required libraries will be installed automatically once the above step is done and the web app will run.
