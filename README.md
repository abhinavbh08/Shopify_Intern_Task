# Shopify_Intern_Task

This is the submission for the shopify backend developer intern challenge - 2022.
I have implemented a basic inventory management system with CRUD functionality.
The additional feature which I have implemented is adding warehouses and assigning items to warehouses along with the quantity of items.
I have used python with flask framework, and sqlite in-memory database for completing the task.

The deployed repl.it for this repository is here: [https://replit.com/@AbhinavBhatt/ShopifyInternTaskv=1](https://replit.com/@AbhinavBhatt/ShopifyInternTask?v=1)
Click on Run and then Open website. The steps are given as 1. and 2. in the picture below.

or 

Alternatively this can be deployed on repl.it by following these steps:
1. Open repl.it and click on create and then import from github.
2. Give the link for the repository while importing.
3. CLick on run.
4. The required libraries will be installed automatically once the above step is done and the web app will run.
If the above alternate procedure is followed, it is highly recommended the view the app in a new tab by clicking the button in replit app window next to the close button to expand to the app to a new tab.
