# Shopify_Intern_Task

This is the submission for the shopify backend developer intern challenge - 2022.
I have implemented a basic inventory management system with CRUD functionality.
The additional feature which I have implemented is adding warehouses and assigning items to warehouses along with the quantity of items.
I have used python with flask framework, and sqlite in-memory database for completing the task.
